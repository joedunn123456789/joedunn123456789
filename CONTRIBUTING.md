## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Use TypeScript strict mode** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Define proper interfaces** - Place in `src/types/`
- **Export types** - Make reusable types available
- **Use type inference** - Don't over-annotate when TypeScript can infer

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const getUser = (id: string): User => {
  // implementation
}

// Avoid
const getUser = (id: any): any => {
  // implementation
}
```

### React Component Guidelines

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Prefer named exports** for components
- **One component per file** (except small, tightly coupled sub-components)
- **Props interfaces** should be defined above the component

**Example:**
```typescript
// src/components/MyComponent/MyComponent.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onSubmit: (data: string) => void;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ title, onSubmit }) => {
  return (
    <div>{title}</div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Tailwind CSS Guidelines

- **Use Tailwind utility classes** - Avoid custom CSS unless necessary
- **Responsive design** - Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints
- **Consistent spacing** - Follow the spacing scale (p-4, m-8, etc.)
- **Extract components** - If a pattern repeats, create a component

### File Organization

```
src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   └── ComponentName/
│       ├── ComponentName.tsx
│       └── SubComponent.tsx
├── pages/                # Page-level components
├── data/                 # Static data and initial states
├── types/                # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── utils/                # Utility functions
└── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (`ResumeBuilder.tsx`)
- **Files**: camelCase for utilities (`pdfExport.ts`)
- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (`getUserData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_ITEMS`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase, descriptive (`ResumeData`, `UserProfile`)

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
feat(resume-builder): add skill level indicators

- Added dropdown for skill proficiency levels
- Updated ResumeData interface
- Modified PDF export to include levels

Closes #42
```

```bash
fix(pdf-export): resolve filename sanitization issue

Fixed bug where special characters in names caused PDF export to fail.

Fixes #38
```

```bash
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Added troubleshooting section for npm install issues
```

### Commit Best Practices

- **Write clear, descriptive messages**
- **Use present tense** ("add feature" not "added feature")
- **Reference issues** when applicable (#issue-number)
- **Keep commits focused** - One logical change per commit
- **Test before committing** - Ensure code works
